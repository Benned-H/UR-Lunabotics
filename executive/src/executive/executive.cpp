[Instance] The robot will turn around and locate the target beacon.
[If, target beacon is located]
The robot will reduce uncertainty about its distance far from the collector bin.
The front end of the robot must have crossed into the Mining Arena, which begins 4.39 m from the starting zone.
[If, robot x < 4.39 m] Move into the Mining Zone.
Transition to the Mine state once the robot is properly within the Mining Zone and in an unmined lane (based on previously mined lanes).
